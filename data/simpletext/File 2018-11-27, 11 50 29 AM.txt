Jossberger, Brand-Gruwel, Boshuizen & Wiel (2010) describe the importance of
self-regulating learning when learning skills in vocational education. She
Describe self-regulating learning as the process of learning what every learner goes through
and where he himself gives direction and content. The self-regulating learner is capable of being
learning strategy and discovering what adaptation is needed in its learning strategy.
Exchanging experiences in and with the social context helps the learner. Also is
the self-regulating learning requires that the learner is 'owner' of his own thoughts and
take action and responsibility for the consequences of this in the social context.
Alheit (2009) also describes that basic skills such as writing and reading should be linked
must be a practical experience (for example, an imposed imposed task). Right
exchanging the different experiences means that the schedules are adjusted.
We speak explicitly about self-regulation and not about self-management because our learners do
design their learning strategy themselves but do not determine their goals beforehand (what happens with
self-steering is the case). After all, the task is usually imposed externally.
