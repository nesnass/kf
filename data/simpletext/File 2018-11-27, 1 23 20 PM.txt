Tennant (2009) argues that the personality is social and social in every person
processes have a continuous impact on this. Man needs his environment to be himself
develop. Schemes change continuously, where there is different per person
adjusted. Mezirow (2009) states that a scheme consists of four components: earlier
learning processes, experiences, cultural background and interactions. From this we conclude that our
learners go through the learning trajectory differently due to their different schedule.
