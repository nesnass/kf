According to Illeris (2009), this has the result that nothing new is learned but the existing one frameworks and concepts are further fixed. In addition, an individual can choose not to want to learn
to show a situation and mental defense or resistance as a blockade for learning (Illeris, 2009). 
Illeris (2009) also says that mental resistance can have a lot of potential for accommodation and even transformative learning processes because something new arises when something is not simply accepted.
In the snail model we have shown the four learning processes as loop because the outcome of the learning process becomes part of the total person. The loops are shown from large to small to suit
indicate how great the impact of that learning process is on the total person. After going through one of the learning processes there is a moment of reflection (8). Korthagen (2001) describes reflection as the ability
to look back in a structured way on an experience in order to draw conclusions for the future to trade. Reflecting on the learning process or the learning outcome can lead to the passing of a new one
learning process or ending in 'enriching' the total person (Jarvis, 2009). That's why the snail model goes from the reflection an arrow to the total person (2). The learner determines to which level is reflected
and whether the learning leads to adjustment of his identity or frame of reference. Korthagen (2001) uses the onion model with 6 levels of change (see figure 2), from the outside to the core: environment, behavior, skills,
convictions, identity and involvement.
