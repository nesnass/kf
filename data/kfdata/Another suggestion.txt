Hi Fernando! As I understand, removal of stop words are in place for some languages (i.e., English and French), so we need to extend this work for additional languages. Agreed that filters would be useful, as well as a level of interactivity that allows users to select keywords in the word cloud to see who is using those keywords in which notes.
[ - Have you seen this interactive word cloud? Itwould be great if we could have comparative word clouds that mine discourse from expert online communities (e.g., news, business, entertainment) -- and even more!
