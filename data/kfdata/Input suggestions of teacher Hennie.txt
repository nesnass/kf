Hi Frank,
We notice that KF works in the exploratory  elaborate phase. Students then participate, current first-year students indicate that KF is being used during the exploratory phase of literature. But then it becomes 'a chaos' and they decide to continue working f2f or in other ways. Similar are findings from research: diverting through KF online tools 'succeeds' but converging much less.
The transcendence in KF should be used for convergence  synthesis and description of better ideas, but is little used. Why? Because we expect words there?
My suggestion is that we could use a tool that would make collecting underlying insights easier. And that we could try that through a concept map (I once submitted, when Sylvi was there) No idea if anything happened.
I imagine that a kind of input field will become available in kf, with which a 'summary' or synthesis of insights from previous notes can be made in very quick strokes through a concept map, with room for a more comprehensive insight and a new question  follow-up direction for the new conversation.
Could this be built?
Greeting, hennie
