Thanks, Fernando! I agree with your suggestion to filter words according to different views/users/groups.
I think ""word"" is a very important representation that shows how deep the community goes. As a primary science teacher, I want my students to clearly ""see"" the community, so I use the word network from KBDEX: students can clearly see what they were talking about as well as the relationships among those keywords. However, there is still a problem for the whole word network: when there are too many key words, it might be difficult to select which word they should learn first. 
I saw a new function of ""word association"" from another platform. When a student chooses a note, some notes associated with this note will appear on the other side. For example, when we choose one note of ""stomach"", then other notes with the keywords of ""digest"", ""mouth"" and ""intestine"" will present on the other side.
Is it possible to embed the word association function in KF6? I think this function is of high potential to help students: 1) identify relationships among different keywords 2) conceptualize mindmap for the whole community.
