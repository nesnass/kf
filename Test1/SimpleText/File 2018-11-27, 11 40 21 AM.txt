According to Jarvis (2009), the disjuncture is the present feeling of discomfort and / or ignorance,
the awareness of the difference between the current and desired situation. He assumes that there
a disjuncture is needed to learn. Metacognition "includes the concrete, observable, cognitive
activities with which pupils orient themselves to a learning task, monitor their learning process
(`monitoring '), testing, diagnosing and steering while performing a learning task" (Jong, 1992).
Flavell (1979) describes that metacognitive knowledge helps learners to understand what they are
learn and how they learn this. With the help of metacognitive knowledge the learner determines his strategy
dealing with a self-or externally imposed task. So there is an interaction between
metacognitive knowledge and disjuncture. According to Flavell (1979) there is a difference between one
self-imposed task or purpose and an externally imposed task or goal. There is more often among our learners
speak of an externally imposed task or goal. Flavell (1979) emphasizes that it is external
imposed (e) task or purpose it is important that the learner realizes that he is the owner of the
disjuncture. If this task is experienced as difficult, metacognition knowledge and experience ensure that
the learner deliberates with others who have experience with this task. Then this will take care of it
consult the learner to link this to his existing knowledge / experience.
What Flavell (1979) calls knowledge / experience is what we call the scheme. We see in our practice
often that the trainer feels more owner of the disjuncture than the learner himself.
