OWNERSHIP OF THE DISC UNIT IS NECESSARY IN LEARNING
According to Jarvis (2009), the disjuncture is the present feeling of discomfort and / or ignorance, the awareness of the difference between the current and desired situation. He assumes that a disjuncture is needed to learn. Metacognition "encompasses the concrete, observable, cognitive activities with which pupils orient themselves to a learning task, monitor their learning process (` monitoring '), test, diagnose and steer while performing a learning task "(Jong, 1992). Flavell (1979) describes that metacognitive knowledge helps learners to understand what they are learning and how they learn it. With the aid of metacognitive knowledge, the learner determines his strategy in dealing with a self- or externally imposed task. So there is an interaction between metacognitive knowledge and the disjuncture. According to Flavell (1979), there is a difference between a self-imposed task or goal and an externally imposed task or goal. With our learners there is more often an externally imposed task or goal. Flavell (1979) emphasizes that with an externally imposed task or goal it is important that the learner realizes that he is the owner of the disjuncture. If this task is considered difficult, metacognition knowledge and experience ensure that the learner consults with others who have experience with this task. This consultation then ensures that the learner links this to his existing knowledge / experience.
What Flavell (1979) calls knowledge / experience is what we call the scheme. In our practice, we often see that the trainer feels more owner of the disjuncture than the learner himself.
