Learning has to do with change, but the starting point is to understand that
professionals come up with a frame of reference that is based on activities they have previously and
have learned elsewhere. Changing the frame of reference means that professionals
sometimes leaving behind their previous learning experiences in order to work with colleagues on new ones
to jointly develop perspectives (Bolhuis and Simons, 2011). That requires development
of a good understanding of the experiences that the current frame of reference can challenge on one
way that is acceptable and reliable (Tennant, 2009). Leave in the model below (figure 1)
we see that changing the frame of reference is influenced by the four elements,
social interaction and contexts.
