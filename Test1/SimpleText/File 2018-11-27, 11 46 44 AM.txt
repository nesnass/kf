According to Jarvis (2009), the disjuncture is the present feeling of discomfort and / or
ignorance, the awareness of the difference between the current and desired situation.
He assumes that a disjuncture is needed to learn. Metacognition "includes the
concrete, observable, cognitive activities with which pupils orient themselves
on a learning task, monitoring their learning process (`monitoring '), testing, diagnosing and
steering during the execution of a learning task "(Jong, 1992). Flavell (1979) describes
that metacognitive knowledge helps learners to understand what they are learning and
how they learn this. The learner determines with the help of metacognitive knowledge
strategy in dealing with a self- or externally imposed task. So there is one
interaction between metacognitive knowledge and the disjuncture. According to Flavell
(1979) there is a difference between a self-imposed task or goal and an external one
imposed task or goal. With our learners there is more often an external one
imposed task or goal. Flavell (1979) stresses that in an externally imposed (e)
task or goal it is important that the learner realizes that he is the owner of the
disjuncture. If this task is experienced as difficult, metacognition provides knowledge and
experience that the learner will consult with others who have experience with
this task. Then this consultation ensures that the learner links this to his already
existing knowledge / experience.
