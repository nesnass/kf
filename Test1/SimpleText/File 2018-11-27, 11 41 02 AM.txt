It is also necessary within self-regulating learning that the learner is 'owner' of his own thoughts
and takes actions and responsibility for the consequences of this in the social context. Also
Alheit (2009) describes that basic skills such as writing and reading should be linked
to a practical experience (for example an imposed imposed task). Just the exchange of
the different experiences make the schedules adjusted.
We speak explicitly about self-regulation and not about self-management because our learners do
to shape their learning strategy but not to determine their goals in advance (which in self-management does
case). After all, the task is usually imposed externally.
