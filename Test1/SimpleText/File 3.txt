Processes of learning
In essence, learning can be defined as meaning (Bolhuis & Simons, 2011). Kegan (2009) names this as 'meaning-forming' and 'reforming our meaning-forming'. By this he means that we not only form meaning, but also change the form with which we give meaning a place. The processes of learning, of giving meaning, go on for a lifetime, this happens consciously but will also take place unconsciously among our young people (Bolhuis & Simons, 2011).
Illeris (2009) distinguishes two basic processes of learning: the external interaction process that involves the interaction between the individual and the environment, which initiate the impulses of the learning process and the internal acquisition process that involves the acquisition of knowledge of the individual, where both the learning content (that which is learned, the cognitive) as the motives of learning (mental energy, the emotional) play a role. Both processes must be active, if learning is to be able to take place. Learning always includes three dimensions: the content dimension (that which is learned), the motive dimension (which drives learning) and the interaction dimension (the impulses that initiate the learning process). All this embedded in a socially situated context.
