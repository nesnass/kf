Previous learning processes, experiences, cultural background and interactions form the frame of reference of a person and thereby the mental, motivation and emotional components ( Mezirow , 2009). According to Mezirow (2009), this frame of reference is a " way of knowing " and encompasses what he calls thinking habits and a position. Thinking habits can be explained as a collection of faith, memory, judgment, attitude and feelings that are a given concept ' form ' to give. The thinking habit is expressed in a position, for example, how we understand a different culture. The point of view can change when we experience a new experience, but it does not mean that the thinking habit will change. For that reason, learning with regard to the frame of reference is either extending or distorting the existing frame of reference ( Mezirow , 2009).
Learning has to do with change, but the starting point is to understand that professionals come up with a frame of reference that is based on activities that they have learned earlier and elsewhere. Changing the frame of reference means that professionals sometimes have to leave behind their previous learning experiences in order to jointly develop new perspectives with colleagues (Bolhuis and Simons, 2011). This requires development of a good understanding of the experiences that can challenge the current frame of reference in a way that is acceptable and reliable ( Tennant , 2009) . In the model below (figure 1) we show that changing the frame of reference is influenced by the four elements, social interaction and the contexts.
