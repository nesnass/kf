By promoting the interaction between professionals, you are causing a greater change
the frame of reference of the professional and the professional context. Understanding each other and speaking
a common language within the professional context is an important part of learning. So
the creation of new knowledge together with others is made possible in professional practice. In

essential part of learning. The professional context is called Wenger (2009) a Community of Practice
(CoP). It is what professionals discover together with each other, and based on that, something
design news.
